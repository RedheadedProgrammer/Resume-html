    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I’m a Computer Science student who loves exploring the world of technology and creativity. I’m working toward becoming a full-stack developer because I enjoy building things that are both functional and user-friendly.

        Alongside my technical interests, I’m also passionate about graphic design and video editing. I love bringing ideas to life visually, whether it’s designing something eye-catching or putting together a story through video. These creative skills often complement my coding projects, allowing me to add a personal touch to everything I create.
        
        I’m always curious and eager to learn new things, whether it’s diving into the latest web technologies or experimenting with new design techniques. I thrive on collaboration and enjoy turning challenges into opportunities to grow.
        
        Let’s connect—I’d love to chat about tech, design, or anything in between!</p>
